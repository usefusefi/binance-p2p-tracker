Create a system that scrapes and displays real-time trade data from Binance P2P, letting users filter by buy/sell, currencies (USD, CAD, or ALL), cryptos (USDT, USDC, BTC, BNB), and payment methods (with wildcard search for max flexibility). The data—Advertisers, Price, Available/Order Limit, and Payment Method—should pop up in a clean, interactive UI that feels alive with every refresh. Ready to code this beast? Let’s break it down.

🎯 Requirements (The Blueprint)
Hit the Source: Connect to https://p2p.binance.com/ and pull data from their P2P trading table. We’re talking live offers, no stale vibes.
Filter Like a Boss:
Buy/Sell: Toggle between “Buy” or “Sell” to scope out the market direction.
Currency: Filter by fiat currency—USD, CAD, or an “ALL” option to see the global picture.
Crypto: Narrow it down to USDT, USDC, BTC, or BNB. Let users pick their poison.
Real-Time Data Fetch: Keep the data fresh with live updates. Prices move fast in crypto—our system needs to keep up.
Payment Method Magic:
Show all payment methods listed in the Binance P2P table (bank transfers, PayPal, cash, you name it).
Add a wildcard filter (e.g., “bank*” to catch anything with “bank” in it) for ultimate flexibility.
UI That Slaps: Build a clean, interactive interface. Think dynamic tables, dropdowns, and a search bar for payment methods. Make it feel like a trading cockpit—functional but with style.
📊 Data to Display
For every matching trade, show:

Advertisers: Who’s offering the deal (username or ID, keep it clean).
Price: How much per unit of crypto (in the selected fiat).
Available/Order Limit: How much crypto is up for grabs and the min/max order size.
Payment Method: What the trader accepts (e.g., “Bank Transfer,” “Revolut,” “Cash in Person”).
